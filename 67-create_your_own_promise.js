// Promise is widely used nowadays, hard to think how we handled Callback Hell in the old times.

// Can you implement a MyPromise Class by yourself?

// At least it should match following requirements

// new promise: new MyPromise((resolve, reject) => {})
// chaining : MyPromise.prototype.then() then handlers should be called asynchronously
// rejection handler: MyPromise.prototype.catch()
// static methods: MyPromise.resolve(), MyPromise.reject().
// This is a challenging problem. Recommend you read about Promise thoroughly first.

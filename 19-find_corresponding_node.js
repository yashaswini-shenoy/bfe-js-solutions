// Given two same DOM tree A, B, and an Element a in A, find the corresponding Element b in B.

// By corresponding, we mean a and b have the same relative position to their DOM tree root.

// This could be a problem on general Tree structure with only children.

// Could you solve it recursively and iteratively?

// Could you solve this problem with special DOM api for better performance?

// What are the time cost for each solution?
